# Portfolio Website

## Description

This website was created as the module two project in UT's Bootcamp, but also functions as a portfolio website to display the skills learned and projects created throughout the durations of the course. In module two, we learned advanced CSS skills, including: psuedo-elements and psuedo-classes, media-queries, wireframing, css reset pages, and flexbox.
